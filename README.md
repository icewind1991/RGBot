# RGBot

Discord bot that allows users to pick their own color 

## Usage

- Register a [discord bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
- Add a `colors` role to the discord, all color roles will be placed beneath this role.
- Invite the bot into your server with the "manage roles" permissions
- Ensure the bot has permissions higher than the `colors` role

Now any user can set his color by sending a message with a css hex color code (`#rrggbb`)
